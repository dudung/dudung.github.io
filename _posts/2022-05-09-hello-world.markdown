Press Ctrl-Shift-J and copy following line

```js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

paste it to JavaScript console and press Enter. Then these lines

![js-console-hello-world]({{site.url}}/assets/img/js-console-hello-world.png)

are obtained. Image size is `390px` &times; `90px`.

This is actually the first post after Jekyll was reinstalled.

```python
s = "Hello, World!"
for c in s:
  pass
  
print(c, end=' ')
```
